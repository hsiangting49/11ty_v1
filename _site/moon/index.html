            <h2>Moon</h2>
            <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a celestial body that has fascinated humanity for centuries. It orbits our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers, influencing Earth's tides and lighting up the night sky. With a surface marked by craters, mountains, and plains, the Moon serves as a silent witness to the cosmic dance of celestial bodies. Its phases, from crescent to full, have inspired myths, art, and scientific exploration. The Moon's impact on Earth goes beyond its aesthetic allure, playing a crucial role in stabilizing our planet's axial tilt and contributing to the rhythms of life on Earth.</p>
